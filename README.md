# Palaeo Climate Modelling UK
This organisation is a collection of the various researchers (at any level) who use climate models to better understand past climate changes. We have a particular focus on using models written by the NCAS and the Met Office, such as HadGEM3-GC3.1 and UKESM2 (when/if it arrives).
